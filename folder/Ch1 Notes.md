Matthew Viencio Chap 1 Design of Everyday Things Visibility- The principle of visibility should be carefully considered, as only the correct parts must be visible and must give the right message. Designers should give an indicator if a door should be pushed or pulled, especially with grass doors. Visibility has problems in many forms as if there are very few indicators to tell where to get out it can be very difficult to get out. Telephones hold several problems, but they have poor instructions on the lack of visibility and signifiers to make the phone function. Devices in the home develop problems as more appliances are being invented When this happens, it's important to have parts be visible to indicate how the parts operate and how they function Affordances provide strong clues to operations. Ex-Plates push, Balls throw and bounce, door knobs for turning, slots for inserting. When simple things need pictures or labels, the design has failed The affordances of a door are that it signals to require pushing or pulling, without signs for it to be open The telephone was a huge problem when they were first invented. Everyone was confused when learning how to use it to a survey of people, compared to a car, it is much easier to use than a telephone because of the amount of visible indicators there are for the car Mapping is a technical term meaning the relationship between two things, in this case, between the controls and their movements and the results in the world Feedback is sending the user information about what has to be done and what result has been accomplished
